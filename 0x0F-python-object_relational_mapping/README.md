Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using an object-oriented paradigm. In traditional relational databases, data is stored in tables, and relationships between tables are defined by foreign keys. On the other hand, object-oriented programming (OOP) models data as objects with attributes and methods.

ORM acts as a bridge between these two worlds, providing a way to map database records to objects in code and vice versa. The key concepts of ORM include:

Object Model:
In an ORM, database tables are represented as classes, and rows in those tables are represented as instances (objects) of those classes. Each attribute of the class corresponds to a column in the table.

Relationship Mapping:
ORM allows developers to define relationships between classes, mirroring the relationships between tables in the database. This includes one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

CRUD Operations:
ORM simplifies the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on database records by providing a high-level, object-oriented API. Developers can interact with the database using programming language constructs rather than writing raw SQL queries.

Abstraction Layer:
ORM acts as an abstraction layer between the application code and the underlying database. This means that developers can work with high-level objects and methods without having to directly deal with the complexities of SQL.

Portability:
ORM systems often provide a level of database independence, allowing developers to switch between different database systems (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) without having to rewrite significant portions of their code.

Data Validation:
ORM systems often include features for data validation and type checking, ensuring that data stored in the database adheres to the defined data models.

Popular ORM frameworks in various programming languages include SQLAlchemy for Python, Hibernate for Java, Entity Framework for .NET, and Django ORM for Python/Django.

ORM is widely used in modern software development, particularly in web applications, where it simplifies database interactions and promotes code organization and maintainability.
