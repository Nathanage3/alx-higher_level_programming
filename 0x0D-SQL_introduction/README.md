What’s a Database?
A database is a structured collection of data. It is a system used to store, manage, and retrieve information. Databases can range from simple systems that store data in files to complex systems that use sophisticated methods to organize and handle data, often using database management systems (DBMS).

What’s a Relational Database?
A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables, which are organized into rows and columns. These tables can be linked to each other through shared data, which is known as "relations." The relational model is the most common way of storing data in databases and is particularly powerful for handling large amounts of structured data.

What does SQL Stand For?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is used to query, insert, update, and modify data.

What’s MySQL?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It's one of the most popular database systems used in web applications and is a part of the widely used LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack.

How to Create a Database in MySQL
To create a database in MySQL, you would use the following SQL command:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
Replace database_name with the name you wish to give to your new database.

What does DDL and DML Stand For?
DDL: Data Definition Language. It includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which are used to define, modify, and delete database structures like tables and indexes.
DML: Data Manipulation Language. It encompasses commands like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT, which are used for managing data within database tables.
How to CREATE or ALTER a Table
CREATE: To create a new table, you use the CREATE TABLE statement. For example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
ALTER: To modify an existing table, you use the ALTER TABLE statement. For example, to add a column:
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
How to SELECT Data from a Table
To select data from a table, use the SELECT statement. For example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
This will retrieve data from the specified columns of the table that meet the given condition.

How to INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE Data
INSERT: To add new data:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
UPDATE: To modify existing data:
sql
Copy code
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
DELETE: To remove data:
sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
What are Subqueries?
Subqueries are queries nested inside another SQL query. They are used to perform operations that require multiple queries in traditional SQL.

How to Use MySQL Functions
MySQL provides many built-in functions for various operations like mathematical calculations, string handling, date and time processing, etc. For instance, to get the current date, you can use:

sql
Copy code
SELECT CURRENT_DATE();
Each function in MySQL has its own syntax and use case.
